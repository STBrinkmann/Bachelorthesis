In this study, I implemented the Greenspace Visibility Exposure Index (VGVI) [@labib2021a_visibility] to represent eye-level visibility of greenspaces. The VGVI expresses the ratio of visible greenspace to the total visible area an observer can see at a specific location. For that a viewshed analysis is conducted to estimate dichotomous visibility (e.g. visible, not visible). Visible areas are intersected with the LULC derived binary greenness raster (e.g. green, no-green), to calculate the proportion of visible greenspace to overall visible area. Finally, all values within the raster are summarised using a distance decay function to account for the reduced visual prominence of an object in space with increasing distance from the observer.

Elevation data has been used in the viewshed analysis and the VGVI has been calculated for the complete study area on a regular point-based grid with 5 m intervals, except for when the point represents buildings or water (n = 16,243,938). After computation, the point grid has been aggregated to a continuous raster with 10 m spatial resolution using an Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation algorithm. VGVI and the IDW interpolation were computed using the `GVI` R package [@brinkmann2022_GVI]. Total computation time with 22 CPU cores was 213 minutes, with an average of 17.3 milliseconds per point.
